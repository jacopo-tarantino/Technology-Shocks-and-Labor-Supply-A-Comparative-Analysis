# Technology-Shocks-and-Labor-Supply-A-Comparative-Analysis

Empirical study examining the response of labor supply to technology shocks, contrasting the opposing
findings of Gali (1999) and Christiano et al. (2003). Using data from the FREDII database, this analysis
computes log labor productivity and per-capita hours for the nonfarm business sector. Two VAR(4)
models and Wold impulse response functions with 68% bootstrap confidence bands are estimated to
identify technology shocks and their impact
